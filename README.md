## For our professor:

  Our app is currently being hosted on thorland, the Data Science machine learning computer. To access the website, navigate to thorland.luther.edu:5000 note: the website can only be accessed on the Luther network. There have also been issues connecting to the host that is out of our control, but it is deployed in it's most current version.
