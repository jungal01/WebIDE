# WebIDE

This is version 2.1.5 of WebIDE, Designed by Allen Junge, Kevin Cobble, Eros Casas, and Jason Hu.

## Setting Up

  1. run `build-project.sh`
  
    * This will install several packages, add multiple PPAs, and <code>curl</code> multiple applications. For information, select <code>i</code> when prompted.
    
  1. start the docker file and navigate to `0.0.0.0:5000`
    
    * An alternative method is to run the command <code>export FLASK_APP=app.py && flask run</code>

## For our professor:

  Our app is currently being hosted on thorland, the Data Science machine learning computer. To access the website, navigate to thorland.luther.edu:5000 note: the website can only be accessed on the Luther network. There have also been issues connecting to the host that is out of our control, but it is deployed in it's most current version.


## Future works

  * Syntax highlighting
  * In-app tabs
  * Simultaneous language support
  * Scalable hosting
  * Design a logo
  * load balancing and multi-user support
